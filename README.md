# Homework_02
Second homework assignment, bootstrap portfolio

This is the second homework assignment for class, focused on creating a responsive portfolio site using Bootstrap.
It mainly utilizes fluid containers, with a few hammered in bits around the footer to accommodate different pages.
Primarily cards are used to achieve most functions, but for the About Me (index) keeping everything in a responsive container worked best.

There are 3 pages, all of which have responsive navs
## Index (About)
## Contact
## Portfolio

URLs for Repository and application are posted to Bootcampspot.

Screenshot of Repository structure is in Repository as well (I think that's what we were told was best practice.

This assignment broke my brain and has made me highly suspicious of Bootsrap, CSS, and all partiese associated with them. I shall have nightmares of float tags, divs, and navs until my dying days.

## I hope you are happy about that
